This is a how to file, it will tell you where to install these files 
to test it on your own private server.

The custom_sprites.txt and custom_sprites_open.txt go into the config folder
The robot.dm goes in /code/modules/mob/living/silicon/robot and replace the file robot.dm

Any custom icons have to go in icons/mob/custom_synthetic.dmi

The format for custom_sprite.txt is key:job:icon_name.
The key is your login name
The job is what job you have, the current list is;
Standard, Service, Miner, Medical, Security, Engineering, Janitor, Combat, 
Peacekeeper, Hunter, Commando, Combat, Syndicate, and Syndicate Medical
The icon_name is what the icon is named.

If the icon you made has a custom open state, you need to use the custom_sprites_open.txt
the setup is icon_name:type_name
The icon_name is the same from custom_sprites.txt and the type_name is the first part
of the name of the open icons, the open with a cell is called <name>-openpanel +c
This way multiple diffrent icons can use the custom open sprites.

To use ingame, any normal borg will get the option to use any defined custom icon when
selecting icons, and can go back and forth between custom and default icons.

To use ingame as a special spawned borg, ie syndicate or deathsquad, select 
"Special Cyborg Icon pick" and pick as you normaly would
